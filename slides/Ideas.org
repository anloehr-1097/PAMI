#+title: Ideas & TODOs

* Ideas/ notable notions from other papers
** Factor VAE paper
- already stressed that an important downside of semi supervised representation learning is that humans in the loop might not be able to identify certain generative factors (i.e. OOD generative factors)
- Low total correlation *NOT* equivalent to disentanglement (in the sense that disentanglement defined in this paper)



** FactOR VAE and original paper
- current metrics to measure disentanglement leveraged the availability of true geneerative factors on toy datasets
- with OOD generative factors, this is not an appropriate way to do so

** Original Paper
- The key to understanding why maximization of TC(Z, X) makes sense lies in the presentation of the term in terms of Mutual Informatino as well as thet
  representatoin of mutual informattion in terms of entropy. See slide and accompanying comment in latex


* TODOS
- Find Def of TC(X, Z) term. Is it defined as in the paper or is the equation in the paper just after manipulating the orig equatuion,
- Modifications to Factor VAE and $\beta$ VAE
- What are the meaning of the params phi and theta. Make this clear in standard VAE framework explanation
- understand the metrics used in evaluation
- Definition of informativeness is not clear yet
